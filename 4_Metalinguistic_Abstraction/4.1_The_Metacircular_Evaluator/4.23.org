#+Title: Exercise 4.23


Compare the two versions of `analyze-sequence'.  For example,
consider the common case (typical of procedure bodies) where the
sequence has just one expression.  

**** What work will the execution procedure produced by Alyssa's program do? 
It will produce a lambda which when evaluated, the first expression in the sequence will get evaluated then the rest of the expressions will get "analyzed".

**** What about the execution procedure produced by the program in the text above? 
It will construct a lambda for each of the expression in the procedure and return the last expression in a lambda.

**** How do the two versions compare for a sequence with two expressions?
There won't be much difference in computation time for two expressions in both versions, however, the execution procedure from the text will be much faster in large sequences.
