#+Title: Exercise 4.46

The structure of our language is given in a specific order. For instance

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :eval no
  (define (parse-sentence)
    (list 'sentence
           (parse-noun-phrase)
           (parse-verb-phrase)))
#+END_SRC

There's parse-noune-phrase followed by parse-verb-phrase.

If the evaluator evaluated from right to left, this parsing would fail.
