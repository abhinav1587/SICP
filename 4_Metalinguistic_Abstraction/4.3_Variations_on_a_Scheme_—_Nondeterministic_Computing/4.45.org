#+Title: Exercise 4.45

With the grammar given above, the following sentence can be parsed in five different ways: "The professor lectures to the student in the class with the cat." Give the five parses and explain the differences in shades of meaning among them.

I won't explain all the differences, but it's clear from the parses that the input sentence has overlaping structures, causing the parser to go into different search brances.

The shades mainly reside in the cat's location.

Is the professor or the student the owner of the cat?
Or, is the cat following the lecture in the class as a student?

There are other two that I can't think of.
