#+Title: Exercise 4.47
Louis Reasoner suggests that, since a verb phrase is either a verb or a verb phrase followed by a prepositional phrase, it would be much more straightforward to define the procedure `parse-verb-phrase' as follows (and similarly for noun
   phrases):

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :eval no
  (define (parse-verb-phrase)
    (amb (parse-word verbs)
         (list 'verb-phrase
               (parse-verb-phrase)
               (parse-prepositional-phrase))))
#+END_SRC

**** Does this work? Does the program's behavior change if we interchange the order of expressions in the `amb'

In the way that the calls have been ordered, it looks like it will search through all ~parse-verb-phrase~ first then through ~parse-prepositional-phrase~. It might not turn out to be a good parse.

It changes the behaviour since it will change the order of the parse.
