#+Title: Exercise 4.25
Suppose that (in ordinary applicative-order Scheme) we define `unless' as shown above and then define`factorial' in terms of `unless' as
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :eval no
  (define (factorial n)
    (unless (= n 1)
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))
      1))
#+END_SRC

**** What happens if we attempt to evaluate `(factorial 5)'?
Since unless evaluates its arguments, the call to (factorial 5) will never end.

**** Will our definitions work in a normal-order language?
Yes, since unless will not evaluate the usual value until it's needed.
