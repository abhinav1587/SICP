#+Title: Exercise 4.32
The difference is in the way the stream operations are implemented.

In Chapter 3, stream operations contain explicit delay operations,
making it harder to implement new kinds of lazy procedures. In this
section though, there is no need to add delay operations to create
new lazy procedures. The programmer does not have to worry about
the lazy implementation of a new procedure at all, but only to write
the solution.

The lazy evaluator makes the language so much cleaner and elegant,
providing more power to the programmer. This opens up a whole new
world of possibilities.

The extra laziness that the evaluator provides is that all arguments
become lazy as opposed to Chapter 3 where only the second argument
of cons was lazy. This gives more flexibility in designing new types
of data structures where the first argument is also lazy.
