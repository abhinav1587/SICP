#+Title: Exercise 3.38
Suppose that Peter, Paul, and Mary share a joint bank account that initially contains $100. Concurrently, Peter deposits $10, Paul withdraws $20, and Mary withdraws half the money in the account, by executing the following commands:

Peter: (set! balance (+ balance 10))

Paul:  (set! balance (- balance 20))

Mary:  (set! balance (- balance 
                        (/ balance 2)))

**** List all the different possible values for balance after these three transactions have been completed, assuming that the banking system forces the three processes to run sequentially in some order.
| 1     | 2     | 3     | Final value |
|-------+-------+-------+-------------|
| Peter | Paul  | Mary  |          45 |
|-------+-------+-------+-------------|
| Peter | Mary  | Paul  |          35 |
|-------+-------+-------+-------------|
| Paul  | Peter | Mary  |          45 |
|-------+-------+-------+-------------|
| Paul  | Mary  | Peter |          50 |
|-------+-------+-------+-------------|
| Mary  | Peter | Paul  |          40 |
|-------+-------+-------+-------------|
| Mary  | Paul  | Peter |          40 |
|-------+-------+-------+-------------|

**** What are some other values that could be produced if the system allows the processes to be interleaved? Draw timing diagrams like the one in Figure 3.29 to explain how these values can occur.

One example is when Peter reads balance as 100 and before the process completes, Paul sets the balance to 80, Mary's transaction reads 80 and sets it to 40 and the final value of balance is set to 110 by Peter's transaction which completes last.
