#+Title: Exercise 3.46
**** Suppose that we implement test-and-set! using an ordinary procedure as shown in the text, without attempting to make the operation atomic. Draw a timing diagram like the one in Figure 3.29 to demonstrate how the mutex implementation can fail by allowing two processes to acquire the mutex at the same time.

Let's say we have procedures A and B.

When A runs, it is computing (if (car cell) and sees that itâ€™s false and proceeds to acquire the mutex by setting the cell to true. Before this operation completes, B completes the evaluation of test-and-set!. At this point, A and B have both acquired the mutex and violated the serialization rule.
