#+Title: Exercise 3.39
Which of the five possibilities in the parallel execution shown above remain if we instead serialize execution as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :eval no
(define x 10)
(define s (make-serializer))
(parallel-execute 
  (lambda () 
    (set! x ((s (lambda () (* x x))))))
  (s (lambda () (set! x (+ x 1)))))
#+END_SRC

Of all the possibilities, only the 110 value will not be possible. While P1 reads, P2 cannot update the value of x, but P1 can update the value of x whenever the value of (* x x) is ready.
