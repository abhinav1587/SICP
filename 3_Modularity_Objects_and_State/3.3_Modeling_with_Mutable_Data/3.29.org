#+Title: Exercise 3.29
 Another way to construct an or-gate is as a compound digital logic device, built from and-gates and inverters. Define a procedure or-gate that accomplishes this. What is the delay time of the or-gate in terms of and-gate-delay and inverter-delay?

* Solution
De Morgan's Law can be used to transform the Boolean algebra. The substitution form (or P Q) is equivalent to (not (and (not P) (not Q))) where P and Q are input lines.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
  (define (or-gate P Q O)
    (let ((R (make-wire))
          (S (make-wire))
          (T (make-wire)))
      (inverter P R)
      (inverter Q S)
      (and-gate R S T)
      (inverter T O)))
#+END_SRC

The delay time will be:
1 inverter delay time + 1 and-gate delay time + 1 inverter delay time.

Note that 3 inverter delay time was not counted since the first 2 have their signals changed at the same time.
