#+Title:Exercise 3.36

Suppose we evaluate the following sequence of expressions in the global environment:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
  (define a (make-connector))
  (define b (make-connector))
  (set-value! a 10 'user)
#+END_SRC

At some time during evaluation of the set-value!, the following expression from the connectorâ€™s local procedure is evaluated:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(for-each-except 
  setter inform-about-value constraints)
#+END_SRC

Draw an environment diagram showing the environment in which the above expression is evaluated.

* Solution
A new environment is created for every call to set-my-value in the make-connector procedure. Hence there won't be any interference with other calls.
