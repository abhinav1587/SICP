#+TITLE:Exercise 3.3
Modify the make-account procedure so that it creates password-protected accounts. That is, make-account should take a symbol as an additional argument, as in

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :results silent
  (define acc 
    (make-account 100 'secret-password))
#+END_SRC

The resulting account object should process a request only if it is accompanied by the password with which the account was created, and should otherwise return a complaint:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :results silent
  ((acc 'secret-password 'withdraw) 40)
  60

  ((acc 'some-other-password 'deposit) 50)
  "Incorrect password"
#+END_SRC

=The original make-account procedure=

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :results silent
  (define (make-account balance)
    (define (withdraw amount)
      (if (>= balance amount)
          (begin (set! balance 
                       (- balance amount))
                 balance)
          "Insufficient funds"))
    (define (deposit amount)
      (set! balance (+ balance amount))
      balance)
    (define (dispatch m)
      (cond ((eq? m 'withdraw) withdraw)
            ((eq? m 'deposit) deposit)
            (else (error "Unknown request: 
                   MAKE-ACCOUNT" m))))
    dispatch)
#+END_SRC
