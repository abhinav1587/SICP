#+Title: Exercise 3.57
How many additions are performed when we compute the nth Fibonacci number using the definition of fibs based on the add-streams procedure? Show that the number of additions would be exponentially greater if we had implemented (delay ⟨exp⟩) simply as (lambda () ⟨exp⟩), without using the optimization provided by the memo-proc procedure described in 3.5.

* Explanation of number of additions.
The memoized procedure of delay would perform similar to an interative process (tail recursion), doing n additions for the nth Fibonacci. On the other hand, a non memoized delay would perform similar to the recursive procedure of fibonacci, doing (fibonacci n) times additions.

This is possible since the memoized procedure will not calculate the value if it was already computed. It will read it from the table of inputs and their values.
