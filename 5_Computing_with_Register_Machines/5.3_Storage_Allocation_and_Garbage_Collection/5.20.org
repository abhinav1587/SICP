#+Title: Exercise 5.20

** Draw the box-and-pointer representation and the memory-vector representation (as in Figure 5-14) of the list structure produced by

#+begin_src scheme: eval no
          (define x (cons 1 2))
          (define y (list x x))
#+end_src

 with the ~free~ pointer initially ~p1~.

** What is the final value of ~free~?
7

** What pointers represent the values of ~x~ and ~y~?
vX and vY at 1 and 4 representing variables in the global environment.
